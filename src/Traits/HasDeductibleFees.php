/**
 * Trait HasDeductibleFees
 *
 * Provides functionality for managing deductible fees for a Payment.
 *
 * This trait enables a Payment model to accumulate multiple deductible fee items
 * (instances of DeductibleFeeFromPayment) using an internal Collection.
 * The collection is lazily initializedâ€”if it hasn't been set when accessed, it will
 * automatically be instantiated as an empty Collection.
 *
 * ### Key Methods:
 * - **getDeductibleFees()**: Retrieves the current collection of deductible fee items.
 *   If not already set, it initializes the collection.
 * - **setDeductibleFees(Collection $deductibleFees)**: Replaces the current collection with a new one.
 * - **addDeductibleFee(DeductibleFeeFromPayment $deductibleFee)**: Adds a single deductible fee to the collection.
 * - **getTotalDeductibleFees()**: Iterates over all deductible fee items, aggregates their amounts,
 *   and returns a Price object representing the total deductible fees in the default currency.
 *
 * ### Usage Example:
 * ```php
 * // Assume your Payment model uses the HasDeductibleFees trait.
 * $payment->addDeductibleFee(new DeductibleFeeFromPayment('Late Fee', 50));
 * $payment->addDeductibleFee(new DeductibleFeeFromPayment('Service Charge', 25));
 * $total = $payment->getTotalDeductibleFees();
 * echo $total->format(); // e.g., "PHP 75.00"
 * ```
