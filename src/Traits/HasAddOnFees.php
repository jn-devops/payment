/**
 * Trait HasAddOnFees
 *
 * Provides functionality for managing additional fees (add-on fees) for a Payment.
 *
 * This trait enables a Payment model to accumulate multiple add-on fee items (instances of
 * AddOnFeeToPayment) using an internal Collection. The collection is lazily initializedâ€”if it
 * hasn't been set when accessed, it will automatically be instantiated as an empty Collection.
 *
 * ### Key Methods:
 * - **getAddOnFeesToPayment()**: Retrieves the current add-on fees collection. If not already set,
 *   it will be lazily instantiated.
 * - **setAddOnFeesToPayment(Collection $addOnFeesToPayment)**: Replaces the current collection with a new one.
 * - **addAddOnFeeToPayment(AddOnFeeToPayment $addOnFeeToPayment)**: Adds a single fee to the collection.
 * - **getTotalAddOnFeesToPayment()**: Iterates over all fee items, aggregates their amounts,
 *   and returns a Price object representing the total add-on fees.
 *
 * ### Usage Example:
 * ```php
 * // In your Payment model that uses the trait:
 * $payment->addAddOnFeeToPayment($feeInstance);
 * $total = $payment->getTotalAddOnFeesToPayment();
 * echo $total->format(); // e.g., "PHP 3,000.00"
 * ```
